# Release Note

## v12
Simplified Tagging and Improved Stability

This update removes the experimental "Preload" option from the Sticky Tagger for a more streamlined and reliable experience.

- Removed - Experimental Preload for Sticky Tagger: The toggle in the Sticky Tagger's property menu for the experimental preload has been removed. The underlying tagging logic has been improved, making this option no longer necessary. This results in a cleaner interface and more consistent performance.

## v11
Improved Sticky Tagger Reliability

This update introduces an experimental preload option for the Sticky Tagger to address tagging issues in certain environments.

- New - Experimental Preload for Sticky Tagger: A new toggle in the Sticky Tagger's property menu allows you to enable an experimental preload. This feature is designed to improve the reliability of tag application, especially in environments where tagging issues have been observed.

## v10
New feature: Sticky Tagger for Rapid Pointing

This release introduces the 'Sticky Tagger' tool, which is designed to make it quicker and easier to add points to multiple sticky notes at once.

New: Sticky Tagger tool. Select 'Sticky Tagger' from the widget menu. This tool enables you to create a palette of reusable 'Point' widgets.
- New - Tag Palette: Register existing 'Point' widgets as 'tags' in the palette. This preserves their point value and colour.
- New - Apply Tags: Select multiple sticky notes and click a tag in the palette to instantly apply a copy of the point widget to each one.
- New: Bulk Delete: This new function allows you to delete all point widgets within a selection while automatically skipping any widgets registered in your palette.

## v9
New Point Organizer and Enhanced Grouping

This release introduces the "Point Organizer" tool for easier management of multiple points and improves the existing auto-grouping feature.

- New - Point Organizer Tool: You can now select "Point Organizer" from the widget menu. This tool allows you to group or ungroup all selected Point Widgets at once, making it easier to manage them.
- Update - Auto-Grouping Behavior: The auto-grouping feature is now more precise. It will no longer ungroup a Point Widget if the group contains other objects besides the widget and its host. This prevents accidental ungrouping of complex elements.
- Update - Grouping Logic: Improved the grouping logic to prevent the creation of nested groups.
- We've also refactored our code to improve stability.

## v8
Improved Counter Reliability

This update enhances the reliability of the Counter Widget for more accurate counting.

・Refactored the logic for detecting Point Widgets, making it more robust.
・Improves accuracy for both "Manual Selection" and "Containing Section" modes, even with nested items.

## v7
Enhanced Widget Stability with Grouping Feature

This update introduces a new "Grouping" feature for the Point Widget, designed to improve stability and prevent accidental movement.

・Grouping Toggle: A new toggle switch in the property panel allows you to group the Point Widget with its host object (e.g., a sticky note).
・Improved Stability: When grouped, the Point Widget and its host are treated as a single unit. This prevents the point from being moved independently, ensuring it always stays with the intended sticky note.

This feature provides better control and a more stable experience when arranging and moving sticky notes on the board.

## v6
Counter Widget UI Enhancement

This update enhances the user interface of the Counter Widget by adding a visual indicator for the current counting mode.

・Count Mode Icon: An icon is now displayed on the Counter Widget itself to clearly show whether it's in "Manual Selection" or "Containing Section" mode.

This improvement helps you understand the widget's counting scope at a glance, making the counting process more intuitive.

## v5
Enhanced Counting Control

This update gives you more explicit control over how the Counter Widget calculates totals. A new dropdown menu in the property panel allows
you to select the counting scope.

・Manual Selection: This is the default behavior, where the widget counts the points of the stickies you have manually selected.
・Containing Section: When you place the Counter Widget inside a FigJam Section, this mode will automatically count all Sticky Points within
   that section.

This enhancement provides clearer control over the automatic section counting feature, ensuring you always know what's being counted.

## v4
Counter Widget Enhancements

This update introduces significant improvements to the Counter Widget's functionality and user experience.

1. Compact Mode for Counter Widget

A new "Compact" mode has been added to the Counter Widget. This space-saving design displays only the total points and a refresh button, making it ideal for keeping a running tally without cluttering your board. You can switch between "Normal" and "Compact" modes from the widget's property menu.

2. Automatic Section Counting

The Counter Widget is now smarter! If you place it inside a FigJam Section, it will automatically count all Sticky Points within that section without requiring you to select anything. It also provides feedback on the current selection scope (e.g., counting within a specific section or a manual selection).

3. UI & UX Refinements

・The property menu is now context-aware, showing only relevant options for either the Point Widget or the Counter Widget.
・The overall design of the Counter Widget has been polished for better readability and a cleaner look.

## v3
Feature Update: Auto-deletion of Orphaned Sticky Points

We've improved the Sticky Point widget to automatically remove points when their host object is deleted.

Previously, if an object with a sticky point attached was deleted, the point would remain on the  canvas. This update ensures that any orphaned points are now automatically cleaned up, keeping your  board tidy.

Changes:
・Implemented a check that triggers when a sticky point is detached from an object.
・If the host object no longer exists, the sticky point widget will now remove itself.

## v2
Added Point Breakdown Display
・The point aggregation widget can now display a breakdown of how many of each point value are included.
・Clicking "Show details" reveals the count of stickies for each point value, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the team's estimation trends.

## v1
First release.
