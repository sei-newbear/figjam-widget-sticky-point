# Sticky Point widget Specification

## Tagline
Apply customizable point tags to sticky notes and count them up.

## Description
Sticky Point offers a versatile way to enhance your FigJam experience by allowing you to add and manage "Point" tags on sticky notes.

It has two main modes:

**Tagging Mode**
In this mode, you can easily attach Point tags to any sticky note. These tags are fully customizable, allowing you to adjust their size and color to suit your needs. This is perfect for prioritizing tasks, indicating effort levels, or categorizing ideas visually.

**Counting Mode**
When you need to summarize your points, switch to this mode. Simply select the area containing the Point tags you want to count, then click the "Count" button. Sticky Point will instantly calculate and display the total sum of all Point tags. For a deeper analysis, you can click 'Show details' to see a breakdown of how many of each point value were included in the count. This provides quick insights and helps you make informed decisions.

Additionally, the Counting Mode now offers a **Compact Mode** for a more streamlined view, displaying only the total points and a refresh button. For enhanced convenience, if the Counter Widget is placed within a FigJam Section, it will **automatically count all Sticky Points within that section**, eliminating the need for manual selection. The widget also provides clear feedback on the current selection scope (e.g., counting within a specific section or a manual selection).
